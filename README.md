# TUgym Web Platform 🏋️‍♀️

**TUgym** is a university gym management website developed as part of an academic project. It aims to provide students with full access to gym information, schedules, equipment, pricing, and healthy diets — all without the need to visit the gym in person.

## 🎯 Objective

The website was designed to solve key pain points for students interested in the university gym, such as:

- Lack of access to gym working hours and class schedules.
- Unclear pricing and subscription plans.

**TUgym solves all of these problems** by offering a complete and interactive online experience.
